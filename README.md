# Twitch Idle Bot

I'm really lazy and I don't like continually clicking the "special bonus" chest when watching streamers. This is a really simple bot which will automatically do this for you based on pixel/color detection. Can have multiple instances open, so long as the bonus chest is visible in each window.

### Example

### Instructions
I'm not including an .exe as I don't want people to abuse this too much. If you want to use this, you'll have to open the project in visual studio or other and compile it yourself. Once running, set the "special bonus" position by dragging the selector, save, then enable. Enjoy!
